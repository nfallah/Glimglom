# Glimglom
_The final open-ended project created for our AP Computer Science A class_

## Rundown
An attempt to recreate the popular 2D fish-eating genre into 3D -- gone wrong. Swim around in an infinite and increasingly brutal ocean, and (hopefully) chase fish smaller than you. Though, it would be best if you watched out for the larger ones.

## Included
- The Unity project itself (note that when opening Glimglom with Unity, the right scene may not load and must be manually opened through the content browser)
- A complete, playable build of Glimglom
- PDF of the project code

## Specifications
Written in C# and created in conjunction with the Unity game engine and its standard library
